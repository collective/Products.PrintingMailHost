1.1.0 (2018-06-08)
------------------

- Check environment variables in Zope2 `initialize` instead of import time.
  This allows to configure environment-vars in zope.conf and use them when
  starting the instance with slc.zopescript
  [fRiSi]

1.0 (2016-09-20)
----------------

- Treat ``FIXED_ADDRESS`` as a list.  Previously, depending on your
  Plone version. a fixed address could get interpreted as a list of
  single-character email addresses, which of course does not work.
  Now it works properly.  You can also give a list of addresses by
  separating them using spaces: ``one@example.org two@example.org``.
  Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PrintingMailHost/issues/4

0.8 (2015-04-16)
----------------

- Add environment variable ``PRINTING_MAILHOST_FIXED_ADDRESS`` to send
  all emails to a single, fixed address.  PrintingMailHost still needs
  to be enabled, so this is in addition to printing.
  https://github.com/collective/Products.PrintingMailHost/issues/2
  [maurits]

- Since we can enable PMH via an environment variable and thus when not
  running in debug mode / foreground, emails are no longer printed, but
  written to the zope event log.
  [pysailor]

----------------

- Also patch (Secure)MaildropHost when available.

  [dtremea] (2005-10-23)

  setitem method. Bumpped version. Noted changes. And clean up
  whitespaces, of course... ;-)
